# ðŸ›¬ Airport CLI Application

A command-line interface (CLI) Java application that connects to a REST API to query cities, airports, passengers, and aircraft. This CLI is the frontend counterpart to the Spring Boot API hosted in a separate repository.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

This CLI answers the following questions via API:

1. What airports are there in each city?
2. What aircraft has each passenger flown on?
3. What passengers have used a specific airport?
4. What flights are available between two airports?

Optional admin mode allows creation of new cities, airports, and passengers.
